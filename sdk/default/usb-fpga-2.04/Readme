default
-------

This is the default firmware for ZTEX USB-FPGA Modules 2.16a and 2.16b.
It supports:

* Firmware uploading 
* High speed FPGA configuration via USB 
* Storage of firmware and bitstream in non-volatile memory
* Configuration data: Storage of device settings in MAC-EEPROM

The upload utility Default.java creates the configuration data structure
in MAC-EEPROM and can be used to upload the default firmware to EEPROM.
The wrapper scripts prog-*.sh can be used to do that for the respective
FPGA Board.
