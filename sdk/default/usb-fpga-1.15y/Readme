default
-------

This firmware can be used as default firmware for ZTEX USB-FPGA Modules
1.15y and 1.15y2. It supports:

* Firmware uploading 
* High speed FPGA configuration via USB 
* Configuration data: Storage of device settings in MAC-EEPROM

The upload utility Default.java creates the configuration data structure
in MAC-EEPROM and can be used to upload the default firmware to EEPROM.
The wrapper scripts prog-1.15y.sh can be used to do that.
