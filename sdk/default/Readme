This directory contains default firmwares (sub-directories `usb-fpga-*')
and Verilog modules for the default interface.

There are three modules for FX3 (directory `fpga-fx3') and FX2 (
directory `fpga-fx2') based FPGA Boards:

ezusb_gpio.v	4 bi-directional GPIO's
ezusb_lsi.v 	low speed communication using an SRAM-like interface
ezusb_io.v	bi-directional high speed communication using GPIF II / 
		Slave FIFO interface of the EZ-USB
		
The default interface also contains a reset signal which is not 
implemented as a separate module.
