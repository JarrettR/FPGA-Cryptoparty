This example demonstrates the usage of the low speed interface of
default firmware (i.e. it runs with default firmware).

The core of the low speed interface can be found in 
../../default/fpga-fx3/ezusb_io.v (for FX3) and 
../../default/fpga-fx2/ezusb_io.v (for FX2), respectively.
It has an SRAM like port with a 8 bit address and 32 bit data width.

The host software writes data to this interface, the FPGA converts it to
uppercase and stores it such that it can be read back from the host.
