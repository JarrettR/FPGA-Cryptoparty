fx3sdemo
--------

This example demonstrates usage of the SD card. 

It should run on every FX3S based hardware but overwriting firmware in 
RAM only works if either no firmware is installed or another firmware
with FX3 reset support (e.g. default firmwares) is running.

SD card can be accessed through as secondary Flash using the API. 
Performance can be tested using the ../flashbench example.
