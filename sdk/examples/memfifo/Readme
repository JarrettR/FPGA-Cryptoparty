memfifo
-------
This example demonstrates:

* High speed EZ-USB -> FPGA transfers using the default firmware 
  interface
* High speed FPGA -> EZ-USB transfers using the default firmware 
  interface
* Usage of memory (type depends on FPGA Board, see below)

The following FPGA Board / memory types are supported:

FPGA Board	        memory type
------------------------------------------------------------------------
USB-FPGA Module 2.14	DDR3 SDRAM

All memory is used to build a large FIFO. Input of this FIFO is either 
USB or a test pattern generator with variable data rate. Output of the
FIFO is written to USB.

For the communication with the host the default firmware interface is
used, i.e. no special firmware is required.

The host software writes the data, reads it back and verifies it.
Several tests are performed in order to test flow control, data rates,
etc.

The modules are re-usable for many other projects. The example is a good
starting point for many different applications.

Data source source is selected by the GPIO pins the the default firmware
interface:

GPIO 1:0  Source 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0:0       USB Endpoint 6 (EZ-USB Slave FIFO interface)
0:1       48 MByte/s test pattern generator
1:0	  12 MByte/s test pattern generator
1:1	  For debugging: Dummy reads form USB + Test pattern generator 

The HDL sources contain 4 modules:

1a. dram_fifo.v: Implements a huge FIFO from on-board SDRAM.
1b. bram_fifo.v: Implements a smaller FIFO from on-chip BRAM.
2a. ../../default/fpga-fx3/ezusb_io.v: Implements the high speed 
    interface on FX3 based FPGA Boards
2b. ../../default/fpga-fx2/ezusb_io.v: Implements the high speed 
    interface on FX2 based FPGA Boards
3a. ../../default/fpga-fx3/ezusb_gpio.v: Implements GPIO's for mode
    selection on FX3 based FPGA Boards
3b. ../../default/fpga-fx2/ezusb_gpio.v: Implements GPIO's for mode
    selection FX2 based FPGA Boards
4. memfifo.c: The top level module glues everything together.

Debug Board (not required)
--------------------------
LED1: Debug/status output, see SW10
LED2-3: Fill level of the DRAM FIFO
SW10 on: status signals from dram_fifo module
     off:status signals from top level module
