flashbench
----------

A write / read benchmark for Flash memory on ZTEX modules.

ATTENTION: This test may destroy the data stored in Flash memory.

The number of sectors to be tested can be specified using the -s 
parameter.

Four tests are performed:
1. Read test: Backing up data to memory
2. Read/write test: Pseudo-random test data is written and immediately 
   read and compared (i.e. write sector 0, read sector 0, write sector
   1, read sector 1, ...)
3. Write test: Restore data read in Step 1
4. Read test: Verify data written in step 3
