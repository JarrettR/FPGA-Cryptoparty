ucecho
------

This example is intended for all EZ-USB Products.

The firmware (defined in ucecho.c) declares Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 4
(both 512 bytes, double buffered, bulk transfer, belong to interface 0).
All data that is written to Endpoint 4 is converted to uppercase and can
be read back from Endpoint 2.

The driver (defined in UCEcho.java) uploads the the Firmware (ucecho.ihx)
to the EZ-USB Microcontroller if necessary, sends user string to the
device and reads them back.

Uploading the Firmware to EEPROM is also supported by the firmware (e.g. 
using the FWLoader utility).

This example may serve a good starting point for own projects.
