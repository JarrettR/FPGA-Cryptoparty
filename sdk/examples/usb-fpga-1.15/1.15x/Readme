USB-FPGA Modules 1.15x and 1.15d can use the same Firmware and 
Bitstreams. Nevertheless, 1.15x detection can be added by calling the
macro `ENABLE_UFM_1_15X_DETECTION;', see the description in 
include/ztex.conf and the examples below.

The following examples are supported by USB-FPGA Modules 1.15x:
../1.15d/intraffic
../1.15d/mmio
../1.15d/ucecho
