flashbench
----------

A write / read benchmark for Flash memory on ZTEX modules.

ATTENTION: The tests will destroy the data stored in Flash memory.

The number of sectors to be tested can be specified using the 
-s parameter of the host software.

Three tests are performed:
1. Read/write test: Pseudo-random test data is written and immediately 
   read and compared (i.e. write sector 0, read sector 0, write sector
   1, read sector 1, ...)
2. Write test: Pseudo-random test data is written (i.e. write sector 0,
   write sector 1, ...)
3. Write test: Pseudo-random test data is read and compared (i.e. read
   sector 0, read sector 1, ...)
