This example is intended for ZTEX USB-FPGA Modules 1.15. It demonstrates
memory mapped I/O between the EZ-USB FX2 and the FPGA.

The firmware (defined in ucecho.c) declares Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 4
(both 512 bytes, double buffered, bulk transfer, belong to interface 0).
All data that is written to Endpoint 4 is converted to uppercase by
the FPGA and can be read back from Endpoint 2.

This example does the same as the example in directory ../../all/ucecho
except that the uppercase - lowercase conversion is made by the FPGA 
through memory mapped I/O: The EZ-USB FX2 writes the data to address 
0x5001 and reads the converted data back from 0x5002.

The driver (defined in UCEcho.java) uploads the the Firmware (ucecho.ihx) 
to the EZ-USB Microcontroller and the Bitstream (fpga/ucecho.bit) to the
FPGA if necessary, sends user string to the device and reads them back.

Uploading the Firmware to EEPROM is also supported by the firmware (e.g. 
using the FWLoader utility).

This example may serve a good starting point for own projects.
