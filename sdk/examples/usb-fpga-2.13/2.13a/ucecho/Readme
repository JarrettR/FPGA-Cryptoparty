ucecho
------

This example is intended for ZTEX USB-FPGA-Modules.

The firmware (defined in ucecho.c) declares Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 4
(both 512 bytes, double buffered, bulk transfer, belong to interface 0).
All data that is written to Endpoint 4 is converted to uppercase by
the FPGA and can be read back from Endpoint 2.

This example does the same as the example in directory ../../all/ucecho
except that the uppercase - lowercase conversion is made by the FPGA.

The driver (defined in UCEcho.java) uploads the the Firmware (ucecho.ihx) 
to the EZ-USB Microcontroller and the Bitstream (fpga/ucecho.bit) to the
FPGA if necessary, sends user string to the device and reads them back.
