fx2demo
-------

This example should run on all EZ-USB FX2 based devices. It implements 
simple USB input(output and demonstrates the usage of the debug helper.

The firmware (defined in fx2demo.c) declares Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 4
(both 512 bytes, double buffered, bulk transfer, belong to interface 0).
All data that is written to Endpoint 4 is converted to uppercase and can
be read back from Endpoint 2.

The driver (defined in Fx2Demo.java) uploads the the Firmware 
(fx2demo.ihx) to the EZ-USB Microcontroller if necessary, sends user 
string to the device and reads them back.

The amount of transferred and converted characters are written to the
debug  stack and printed out by the host software. See Readme.Debug for
more information.

Uploading the Firmware to EEPROM is also supported by the firmware (e.g. 
using the FWLoader utility).
