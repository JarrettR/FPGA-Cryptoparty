standalone
----------

This firmware can be used for standalone applications where firmware is 
loaded from EEPROM and bitstream is read from Flash memory.

The FWLoader utility is used to upload
1. the firmware to the microcontroller (if no valid firmware is
   running),
2. the firmware into EEPROM and 
3. the FPGA bitstream into the Flash memory,

e.g. by calling

./FWLoader -c -uu standalone.ihx -ue standalone.ihx -um <bitstream>
