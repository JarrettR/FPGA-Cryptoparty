This example demonstrates how data can be read and written to/from the
Flash memory.

During the start-up the firmware (defined in flashdemo.c) reads the
number of last sector n from sector 0 (dword at position 0) and
increments it by one. If n is larger than or equal to the total amount
of sectors, or if it is equal to 0, n is set to 1.

Then n is written back to sector 0 and sector n is filled with the
string "Hello World!".

The host software (defined in FlashDemo.java) reads out the string from
the last sector of the flash memory.
