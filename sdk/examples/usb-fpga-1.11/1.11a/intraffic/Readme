This example shows how the EZ-USB input FIFO interface is used.

A traffic generator sends test data to the EZ-USB. The hosts PC reads
out this data and verifies it.

The traffic generator is implemented in the FPGA and supports two modes:

1. (IOA3=0) This mode supports data flow control using FIFO full flag
   (FLAGB) and SLWR control pin. Use this mode as starting point for 
   data acquisition applications.
   
2. (IOA=3) In this mode and uninterrupted test pattern is generated,
   i.e. flow control is disabled. This mode is used for performance
   measurements (speed rate and interrupt measurements)
