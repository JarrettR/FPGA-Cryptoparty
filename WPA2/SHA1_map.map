ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 2,321 out of 184,304    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                   0
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:            2,321
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      9,675 out of  92,152   10%
    Number used as logic:                    9,673 out of  92,152   10%
      Number using O6 output only:           5,890
      Number using O5 output only:             649
      Number using O5 and O6:                3,134
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  21,680    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     7,548 out of  46,076   16%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        9,675
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         7,354 out of   9,675   76%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of   9,675    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       2,321 out of   9,675   23%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 184,304    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       673 out of     338  199% (OVERMAPPED)
    IOB Flip Flops:                            160
